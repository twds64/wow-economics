This is going to be a personal project to keep my programming skills sharp.
IDK how much programming I'll be doing at work, so this will be a nice way
to keep up with that.

This project started as a want for Victoria 3 because I happen to like that
sort of thing. However, my love really lies in RTS and the economics/politics
of it all, not necessarily in the "Victoria" game, branding, or even
historical era. I was also quite sad when a game had to end in 1936, it felt
like things were just getting good!

The idea then is to create a Vic2 like game, but bigger, better, and most
importantly, LONGER. More resources, more techs, more pops, more nations,
more everything. 

Here are the core concepts I'd like to have at the outset:

(1) Vic2 is about the 'growth' of nations. You are always meant to be
expanding, getting richer, producing more. In this game, you will indeed
expand, however, in the latter half of the game you are meant to grapple with
your expansion. Enormous empires untenable; freedom for oppressed nations;
manage the social and political strife. Try to stay on top? De-colonize but
stay favourable? Rule with an iron fist? Lose it all while trying? This is the
choice you are meant to make.

(2) In order for these choices to be truly compelling, the player must build
the world they manage. This is why the 1800s are still represented in the game.
The idea isn't to be given a post-WWII map and say "do this"; it is to build
the modern era and then grapple with what you have built. This has a few
consequences:
    * The player is meant to be free to play a nation how they see fit.
    * Historic accuracy is NOT a cornerstone of the game.
    * The player's choices should really matter long term, ESPECIALLY if
      they are a major power (or become one).  

(3) The primary focus will be nations and how they shape the world, the 
player being one such nation.

(4) Economics is a huge part of the game; production, trade, and money are
what make the world go round.

(5) The main driver of everything are the people, who are managed in groups
called POPs, much like Victoria. Their decisions, productivity, etc. are the
core foundation on which everything else runs. These nations will only
function as well as their POPs, and how a player manages them, and therefore
their nation, is what will determine a successful and fun game.

(6) Even though its #6, games should be FUN first and foremost. This game will
not be fun for everyone. In fact, I'm just making it for me and no one else
will ever see it. I therefore promise myself to do my best to make sure
anything I add is FUN and services the gameplay. 
    * You can punish the player, but keep it fair. The game is not meant to be
      easy, especially in its 2nd half. BS for difficulty's sake is not what
      I have in mind.
    * Have a cool feature, but it won't make the game better? Don't include
      it. Yes it'd be cool if an island nation is completely destroyed by a
      tsunami, but its not fun, and especially unfair if you happen to be
      playing such nation.
    * Compexity != fun. The fun comes from managing the systems and making
      the best out of a situation. Keep it tight and direct.

(7) This game is going to be pretty intensive computationally.
    * I pledge not to waste the resources at my disposal.
    * Graphics/GUI is not important to me & therefore this game. A fine
      looking sprite that is clear is x100 times better than a beautiful one
      that is too complex to understand at a glance.
    * The flavor can come later in the development. Functionality is the top
      priority.
    * If I have to make a dwarf-fortress-esque interface I will. I'd like to
      make a game actually playable by human beings however.
